        <h1>TV SHOW</h1>
        <p>
            Friends is a 90's Comedy TV show, based in Manhattan, about 6 friends who go through just about every life experience imaginable together; love, marriage, divorce, children, heartbreaks, fights, new jobs and job losses and all sorts of drama. The show starts off with each character in their 20's, and expands over a 10 year period, as each character tries to find happiness, success and what the true meaning of a "friend" really is. Our 6 famous characters are Rachel Green, Phoebe Buffay, Monica Geller, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and Chandler Bing.

        <h1>PREMISE</h1>
        <p>
          In West Village, Rachel Green, a sheltered but friendly woman, flees her wedding day and her rich yet unfulfilling life, and finds childhood friend Monica Geller, a tightly-wound but caring chef. After Rachel becomes a waitress at coffee house Central Perk, she and Monica become roommates at Monica's apartment located directly above Central Perk, and Rachel joins Monica's group of single people in their mid-20s: her previous roommate Phoebe Buffay, an eccentric, innocent masseuse; her neighbor across the hall Joey Tribbiani, a dim-witted yet loyal struggling actor and womanizer; Joey's roommate Chandler Bing, a sarcastic, self-deprecating IT manager; and her older brother and Chandler's college roommate Ross Geller, a sweet-natured but insecure paleontologist.
